MVP:
- single arena that all players load in to
  - on frontend entire arena must be loaded so players can see
    any approaching opponents
- client-server communication which facilitates gameplay
  - Javascript frontend embedded in webpage takes player input and
    displays game state; will handle reading & drawing game state locally
  - Golang (?) backend provides global player states on timed interval
    (i.e if rendered at 30 FPS, then build state messages for every 1/30s)
- point system; resets on player deaths
- timed matches; resets game state after x minutes


Full Specs:
- tiered arenas with a maximum of 5 players at a time
  - progress up tiers via knocking an opponent out OR
    surviving for x seconds without being knocked out
  - after n tiers, a player will score a point and be sent back to
    the bottom tier arena
  - use some ADT to smartly place players so that arenas are as full as possible
- each round now tracks the scored points rather than # of KOs

Extras:
- after reaching the top tier, you choose some sort of 'stat' bonus
  (eg: weight, speed, reduced size) which lasts for the entire round
- over the course of a match the arenas will fall apart
  - requires UI and backend changes
  - implement undirected graph bridge detection to avoid islands (?)
- Artwork: Cutesy faces w/ facial expressions; Snipperclips-esque
- Music: Goofy/upbeat music; Mario Party-esque
